This Repo contains the reports and code for assignments and projects based on a class I had done based on a computer science perspective on synthesizers. 

This contains the following components covered during the course:
Signal processing description: a conceptual overview of the concepts using digital signal processing notation and concepts
Software implementations: software implementations of the concept that focus on understanding and readability
Historical Dive: historical information related to the concept
Software Anatomy: exploring and understand existing implementations of the concept
Music/Videos: fun but releveant things to listen to and view
Guest speakers/conversations: discussion of the concepts covered with experts

We also covered certain topics such as:
Oscillators
Filters
Spectral analysis
Additive and subtractive synthesis
FM synthesis, LFOs, modulation
Protocols (MIDI, Open Sound Control)
Samplers, drum machines, arpeggiators
Sampling and wavetables
Modal Synthesis
Wavescanning
Phasevocoding
Vocal synthesis
Physical Modeling
Virtual analog synthesis
New interfaces for musical expression
